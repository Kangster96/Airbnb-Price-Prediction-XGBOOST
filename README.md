# Airbnb-Price-Prediction-XGBOOST 



Airbnb is an American online marketplace company based in San Francisco, California, United States. Airbnb offers arrangement for lodging, primarily homestays, or tourism experiences.It allows home-owners and renters ('hosts') to put their properties ('listings') online, so that guests can pay to stay in them. Hosts are expected to set their own prices for their listings.

In this project I aim to predict the price of the listings using machine learning models and implementing feature engineering to predict the price of the listings. Airbnb pricing is important to get right, particularly in big cities like Netherlands where there is lots of competition and even small differences in prices can make the difference between optimum occupancy and high earnings, or being priced out of the market. You can find the dataset on http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html.
